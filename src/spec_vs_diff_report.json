  "summary": "Diff implements a 4-page static TanStack Router site (Home, Types & Guide, Reviews, Top Picks) with a shared Tailwind-based layout/theme and detailed static content, including a hero image reference on Home. However, the required generated image assets are not evidenced as added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and additional required images (note icons + mist background) are not shown as used. The diff also introduces Internet Identity/auth + actor/query plumbing, which appears outside the static-content/non-goals scope.",

      "requirement": "Generate and include required static images in the frontend public assets folder and render them in the UI (hero/headers and section accents) without routing images through the backend.",
      "reason": "The UI references the hero image path, but the diff does not show any images added under frontend/public/assets/generated. Also, there is no evidence the required note-icons image or fragrance-mist background image exists or is rendered anywhere.",
