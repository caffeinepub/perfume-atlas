# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a static, premium-themed multi-page perfume website with detailed explanations of perfume types and structured sample reviews.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a static site with 4–5 distinct pages and clear navigation across all pages.
- Add a Home page introducing perfumes and explaining the site structure (types, notes, concentration, reviews) with links to key sections/pages.
- Add a “Perfume Types & Guide” page detailing at least 5 fragrance families, the note pyramid (top/middle/base), and concentration levels (EDT/EDP/Parfum/Cologne).
- Add a “Reviews” page with at least 6 detailed sample reviews in a consistent format (overview, scent profile, longevity, sillage, season/occasion, pros/cons, rating).
- Add one additional substantive static page (e.g., “Top Picks & Brands” or “About / Contact”) to reach a total of 4–5 pages.
- Apply a coherent, creative premium editorial visual theme (Tailwind-based styling) consistently across pages.
- Include required static images under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and render them in the UI (Home hero plus icons/accents on at least one other page).

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse a polished, static perfume editorial website with multiple pages, clear navigation, detailed guides to fragrance types/notes/concentrations, and a set of structured sample perfume reviews enhanced with on-page imagery.
